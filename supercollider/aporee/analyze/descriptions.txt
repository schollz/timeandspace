Köln Thielenbruch forest, on a wooden bridge over creek Kemperbach, forest ambience in early spring<br />(Sony PCM D50, DPA4060)
The change between clearing areas and young wood stands, between light and shade, characterises the image of the nature experience area Moorwiese (slightly more than 5,000 m²). This pilot area was created in close cooperation with the Pankow Youth Welfare Office and the Spielkultur Berlin-Buch association. It is located in the immediate vicinity of the Buch S-Bahn station, adjacent to an adventure playground and offers families and children variety in the direct vicinity of the large housing estates. Together with the adjacent open landscape and in the vicinity of the adventure playground, this nature experience area has a special attraction for children. The Moorwiese nature experience area was opened in September 2016. <br />see also: https://aporee.org/maps/projects/buch<br />(Sony PCM D50, DPA4060)<br />

I was investigating my commute to work and realised that parking at Barton and walking in to Brookes through the quiet backstreets and alleyways was necessary for the clarity and calm I like to bring to my teaching. This is the sound of turning into Cuckoo Lane, a lovely narrow passageway, used by cyclists and pedestrians and with walls high enough to block many traffic sounds. Accidental wildernesses at the end of people's gardens, abutting the alley way, provide residencies for birds of all kinds. All suburban kinds, anyways.

Canadian geese make a lot of noise near the Vas-t'y-frotte island, which is a very strange name. it means... huh, how to explain... in old french, something like : go there and rub you. That's not very clear. In fact, what is sure is that island represent a natural sanctuary, as it was a military domain until shortly. Birds especially go here in colony.

While I Murramarang I was also making a film (durational shots) and realised when I got to this spot that it would be a beautiful spot with the sun just beginning to rise over the forest, so since I all ready had my gear set up I let the mics roll for a few minutes before starting a new recording. Though there is a plane in this recording, planes were very rare there and I didn't hear one for hours after this. There was always a seaplane around dawn unfortunately though.<br />Recorded with a pair of AT4022's into a Tascam DR-680.

northern runway, at the edge of Köln-Bonn airport, which is embedded into a beautiful heathland and forest area, with rich biodiverity. The area is in parts a result of the degradation by military training after WW2.<br />Military exercises with tanks and other vehicles led on the one hand to the fact that the expansion of the forest and bush area was counteracted, a quite useful measure in the nature conservation sense. On the other hand, the loss of valuable biotopes was often associated with this. The practice operation caused ecological damage and resulted in drainage and filling of wetlands. Large areas were used for the barracks. But the military restricted area also meant that nature could develop undisturbed in large parts of the heath. It was also not possible to build residential or commercial buildings on the heath areas. <br /><br />(Sony PCM D50, DPA4060)

Bardonecchia, little ski place in the old way. There is a delicate balance between the sounds of skiers, the voices & the dog reverberating on the next forest, the mecanics of chairlifts, wind, steps on the melting springtime snow &, by the end, the music coming out from the cabin & creating a funny decontextualisation...

Aufnahme der letzten zwei Minuten der Fällung einer Pappel an einem Totarm des Rheins. Die Tonaufnahme entstand etwa 70 m SW von der Quelle des Geräuschs entfernt.<br />Das Hintergrundgeräusch ist ein laufender Traktor, der mit einem gespannten Seil den Baum in eine bestimmte Richtung fallen lassen soll. Am Anfang sind die Stimmen der Arbeiter zu hören, die sich absprechen. Vögel zwitschern, dann wird die Motorsäge gestartet. Die letzten Schnitte am Baum erfolgen, ein Keil wird mit einem Hammer in den Schnitt getrieben. Zuletzt fällt der Baum. (Leider sind trotz Windfell einige Windgeräusche zu hören.) /<br /><br />This Recording of the last two minutes of the cut down of a poplar at the dead water of the River Rhine. The place of the audio recording was in a distance of about 70 m SW from the source of the sound.<br />The background sound is a running tractor that will let the tree fall in a certain direction with a tight rope. At the beginning the voices of the workers are heard. Birds are chirping, the chain saw is started. The last chainsaw cuts are done, a wedge is driven with a hammer in the cut. At last the tree falls. (Unfortunately, despite of a wind coat there can heard some wind noise.)

When I was walking down the street Ive heard urgent sobbing of a cat. Finally I found the cat in small opening under the entrance. Somebody from the house has said to me, that he knows the cat. But I have to go there tomorrow again. It seems, that the cat can	 get out from the cellar.<br /><br /><br />...the other day the cat was gone * so it is safe

Recorded width a DR-100MKII mounted on tripod. Some hikers went by, I was standing beside the recorder, and a friend walked around nearby. There were also some children playing in the woods. The low noise from the autobahn is always in the background at this otherwise beautiful place. In summer there are a lot of people bathing there, but out of the swimming season, just now and then some hikers come by.

spring equinox
Sat outside the beautiful croft cottage we were staying in, the place is amazingly quiet. A single bird is heard (probably Common Sandpiper). This bird's call would echo round the bay for hours on end. Because of its northern location its also surprisingly light (in summer) given that the time is 20.15. Occasional other birds, the wind in the grass, and the faint waves in the loch can also be heard. <br />Equipment: Zoom H4n

The tall grasses in the old river bed were extraordinary on this visit. As usual there was a gusting wind and this was catching the grasses and creating sounds of contact as the stems knocked into one another. We had a sheet of glass with us so i dug a small trench, positioned it among the grasses, attached an AKG C411L and listened to the results. The contact microphone on the glass also picks up the sound of cows, birds and a passing tractor.

Sundaymass Sint Antonius
Made this recording in 2010 when I was doing a lot of exploratory walks around the A4074 road, trying to get closer to the landscape which I am often separated from by my car when I am driving on the road there. I did the walk in two parts, starting in Reading, and taking the footpaths around the A road as it is far too dangerous to walk directly on the road the whole way. I camped overnight in Wallingford on the night of the first day of walking, then met Mark early on, and walked the rest of the way into Oxford. I set up my recorder in the tent before I went to sleep, ready to record the early morning birds. Woke up, put it on, then fell back asleep. In this recording I am dozing with the birds and there is an aeroplane, a little light rain, and some tiny snoring. It was close to 8am if I remember rightly. Just recorded with EDIROL R-09 and its onboard microphones. I kept in the part at the end where I wake up and turn off the recorder!

biking on the abandoned railway, in the forest
to celebrate this year's dawn chorus day, I have choosen a rather common environment to do some recording. it features urban parkland with plenty of human intervention be it party folks nearby, car traffic or airoplains. This noisy backdrop seems to add, however, to the overall choreography of the recording and communicates a sense of location. you'll be able to hear a nice selction of species chiming in, most prominently, of course, the black birds. but listen carefully, there's a lot more to be heard. for instance a tawny owl far in the distance towards the end for quite a considerable while...listening on headphones is recommended.<br /><br /><br />the recording has been made using the roland R-05 recorder with its in-build stereo mics. original format properties: wav 96.0khz/24bit

Crows and other birds speak to each other in the reverberant place. Their voices woke me up. It is cloudy. One of the crows fly by near my recording spot. There is a noise of the huge twenty lane highway (Leningradsky Prospekt) on the background. Trees have no leafs yet, so you can clearly hear the traffic that circa 700 meters away from the recording spot. <br />Recorded on Zoom H5 built-in X/Y stereo microphone by hand.

The European Honey Bee (Apis mellifera) has long been introduced into Australia and in many places they have replaced the beautiful native bee's, vastly changing the ecology, sometimes even to the extent that certain species of flowering plants no longer exists in areas because they depended on the native bee's for pollination.<br />Recorded with a pair of AT4022's and two JrF contact microphones into a Tascam DR-680.<br />Unlayered excerpt from this composition: https://soundcloud.com/jeremyhegge/winter-jibbon-head

This is the sound of Brian Knowles's Rams when we went to feed them. You can hear Brian shaking the food for them, as sheep are generally pretty quiet in the winter time, but soon get noisy if they sense the possibility of food to hand! I am not completely certain that I have located this file correctly, but it's the best I can do with the maps and the memories I have of travelling around the Lake District last January. Brian and Jane Knowles live at High Borrow Farm in Selside, but their land from memory seemed to stretch in several directions, and a lot of it was right there on the main road.

Late Autumn, leaves have already fallen from almost all of the trees and lay on the ground after a strong rain. The water is still dropping from the empty trees onto the fallen leaves and puddles formed along the trails, with the help of the wind. Birds make themselves noticed and a dog is curious. Not so far there is a highway and the cars collectively build a background sound while sometimes powerfull motors stand out. Recorded with a Zoom H1n.

A quite uncommon sound...<br /><br />I was walking threw the forest. My attention was drawn to a strange sound in the pines, it was a permanent and strong cracking. I through of the pines, but, going near the trunks, I heard nothing. It was coming from the ground, into the ground or perhaps near the ground.<br /><br />I through about insects, but digging, there were nothing special.<br /><br />In fact, it's the ferns growing. Wishing to understand, I put a contact microphone into the ground, crackings were here too. Also, I went back in this forest by night, and there were nothing excerpt a beautiful moon. Crackings are here only with the sun, and (almost) only in the thick and dense heaps of dead ferns. Digging into, there's small green young ferns.<br /><br />To record this sound, I simply put two binaural microphones in an heap of dead ferns. I guess the crackings comes from the new ferns, pushing hardly the ground into the humus.<br /><br />Searching on the internet about ferns sounds, I found nothing (probably because of my bad english). If somebody has an explanation about this strange happening, contact me and please help, I will complete the description.<br /><br />First recording, I attempted to record the crackings. There's a lot of planes. Recording made with microphones laid on the ground. Second recording without planes and microphones put in an heap of dead ferns.

A clip from a soundwalk in the center of Thessaloniki. Rotonda is a famous roman- byzantine temple in the center of the city. You can hear birds which find trees in order to rest and also a lot of children playing around on the pedestrian. Old monuments construct urban discontinuities necessary for a better habitation in a city.

Some of the amazing sounds we heard while hiking the Lone Star Trail through Sam Houston National Forest. It turned out to be a pretty challenging day for my gear with some pretty fierce wind penetrating my D50's Rycote windscreen and muddling up my recording a bit. If there's anybody out there that has had some success at solving this issue in the gusty wind, please message me. <br /><br />I was crouching in a bog-like area near the lake, listening to distant toads, when some much closer frogs and toads erupted with mass calls. The air traffic is pretty constant in this area but otherwise, I found the virtual silence I was looking for that day; a brief reprieve from the sometimes oppressive sounds of living in inner city Houston.<br /><br /> Recorded with a Sony PCM D50 and inadequate wind protection!

Recorded beside an old power plant with a precariously bent brick chimney at Vogelsang. Trees now grow unhindered throughout this abandoned Soviet military base, now a nature reserve. It is a 2km walk from the station or nearest road. One is free to explore the derelict buildings, which are open to the wind and weather. It is an atmospheric place that surprises with unexpected details like colourful murals and attractive wallpapers in decaying rooms. There is a onetime theater and a sports hall with ancient heating pipes dangling down the walls. Lenin still stands carved out in stone. Forest wildlife is abundant and the springtime birds a joy to hear.

"Half-hidden in Singapore, the Bukit Brown cemetery is a sprawling ground of greenery and heavy gravestones. On many of the stones the miniature portraits are fading or faded, their names unrecognized and stories forgotten. <br /><br />But other graves are still visited by faithful relatives, bringing flowers and incense for their ancestors. Along the paths one finds joggers and children riding horses in a rare space of untouched nature.<br /><br />At around 200 hectares, the land on which the cemetery sits is a luxury for a city-state hungry for space. In 2011, the government announced plans for a dual four-lane road that would run through part of Bukit Brown. Construction would require the destruction and exhumation of 5,000 graves.<br /><br />Conservation groups such as SOS Bukit Brown and All Things Bukit Brown have come together to fight to preserve the cemetery. In October 2013, Bukit Brown was included in the 2014 World Monuments Watch list.<br /><br />But the government remains resolute. “[P]lanning for the long term in land-scarce Singapore does require us to make difficult trade-off decisions. We will have to continue to ensure that sufficient land is safeguarded island-wide, and find ways to make good use of our limited land in order to meet future demand for uses such as housing, industry and infrastructure,” a spokesperson of the Urban Redevelopment Authority told the press."<br /><br />http://thediplomat.com/2013/10/singapore-the-fight-to-save-bukit-brown/<br /><br />"The process of exhumation and highway planning had started in March 2012. The result will be the losing of 5000 graves, destroying the forest, bio-diversity, global warming and other environmental impacts like the risk of flooding."<br /><br />http://sosbukitbrown.wordpress.com/<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />//////////////////////<br />Recordist : Stéphane MARIN<br />//////////////////////<br />ZOOM H4n built-in rec.<br />//////////////////////<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />//////////////////////<br />This phonography was recorded for the project<br />"An Umbrella for 2" <br />at the occasion of <br />Singapore Arts Festival 2012<br />//////////////////////<br />http://www.espaces-sonores.com/#!an-umbrella-for-2/c1qg7<br />//////////////////////<br />Cette phonographie a été enregistrée <br />pour le spectacle "Un Pépin pour 2" <br />à l'occasion du<br />Singapore Arts Festival en 2012<br />//////////////////////<br />http://www.espaces-sonores.com/#!un-ppin-pour-2/c111t<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />//////////////////////<br />© Espaces Sonores<br />//////////////////////<br />http://www.espaces-sonores.com/<br />//////////////////////<br />https://soundcloud.com/espaces-sonores<br />//////////////////////<br />http://espaces--sonores.bandcamp.com/<br />//////////////////////<br />https://www.facebook.com/ESPASON<br />//////////////////////<br />https://twitter.com/espaces_sonores<br />//////////////////////

Listening to the birds and the wind in the trees, she tells us about the sounds she can still hear in her memory, like her father working in the bakery downstairs… One sound features strongly, and comes in live… (it’s the traditional call for the prayer called “Angulus” in the Catholic Church; it rings at 7am, 12 noon and 7 pm)<br /><br />Wir sitzen mit Irmgard Fatheuer an ihrem Fensterplatz und blicken in die grossen Bäume des Kirchgartens.

There was a huge barn on the campsite where we were staying, and it was full of birds including swallows and swifts and blackbirds and wood pigeons (I think). The big resonant barn amplified their songs in such a lovely way that I wanted to document it. EDIROL R-09 left on top of an old boiler for 35 minutes - this is an excerpt of a much longer recording.

Into the forest, wind sound in the pines needles and birds singing during spring time.
stopping to listen to the common soundscape in the late afternoon of early spring… frogs, crows, birds, bumblebee, far away voices...
Sumburgh Head is very popular with walkers, as you can quite easily see Puffins around there, and occasionally Whales are spotted from the viewpoints around the cliffs. It is an extraordinarily beautiful place, bordered on all sides with steep rock edifices, and on the grassland all around the car park, sheep are grazing. I am not sure that these sheep are actually grown for wool; they looked like meaty little Suffolk sheep rather than Shetland sheep grown for wool, but as is often the case in Shetland where you are never more than 3 miles from the coastline, there is a wonderful mix of grazing and pastoral sounds with maritime and seaside sounds. At this moment, a lamb was quite insistently baa-ing, very close to me on the path. As I stood very still, listening and recording with my trusty EDIROL R-09, a family passed me on the path, and several birds (I think perhaps even some oyster catchers?) flew by overhead.

Pausing at the service station on the M25 home, we were sitting having our coffees when I realised that the service station soundscape really reminded me of a huge swimming pool. The hum of electricity, the fraught children yelling, the huge expanses of glass reflecting all the sounds... ok the coffee-making sounds are less swimming-pool like but the din of many people in a large, reflective space was quite astounding. What a soup of noises. I drank my coffee and tuned in to the soup. Weirdly, you can't see the services at all on the aporee map; I think the satellite imagery predates this build. It feels very strange to overlay this very industrial, car-related racket onto a green field site. But I did double check the post-code and this is where the sound is. Maybe in thousands of years time aporisti will overlay this recording with the sounds of birds and trees once again.

This is one of my first experiments recording with a Sound Devices; the set-up is Sound Devices 702 plus Audio Technica BP4029 stereo microphone. I am not sure if I had the channels linked correctly, as I had to boost the left a little in post-production to balance left and right channels. Haren is a very quiet district on the outskirts of Brussels, and the day we visited was very windy. There are many trains passing through, and lots of quiet green pockets of land. I was standing in a sheltered spot beside the wall that surrounds St Catherine's Church. I could hear very close by, the sounds of birds and the wind moving through the ivy; and more distantly, the trains passing and traffic moving gently in the nearby square. It is not my favourite recording ever; it's a little windy in places. However it does document a careful listening experience in what was to me a completely foreign land and sound scape.

One of the first days of spring, and the garden felt beautifully alive. It was a Sunday, and we were returning home from a wonderfully romantic Wedding. The sunny street was its usual quiet Sunday self, with the murmur of traffic from the nearby main road drifting over and mixing with the chatter of the birds in the trees in the gardens. As we unpacked the car, I noticed that many small bees were busily working at the pink flowers in a nearby quince bush. I remembered this is an annual sound for us, and I popped my little recorder down inside the foliage to capture the sound of this labour. You can hear along with their buzzing, the light hand of the wind rifling through the stiff branches, and the aeroplanes that constantly pass over this area, giving the days in our street their distinctive sense of time. There is also a bird perching in the winter flowering cherry blossom tree, whose song delights for the last portion of the recording.
Into the forest, the Seine river is flowing in a very bucolic landscape. A lot of Grey Wagtail are flying and singing. It's a discreet sharp shout, always near the water or over the river.

The birds are doing their song and dance on the far side of the fence on the paper recycling plant property. There are at least two birds singing, however the majority of calls are coming from a single bird: a repetitious pleat, followed by a long chirping while in vertical flight, then a short low cackle. Sounds from the recycling plant can be heard throughout.

Birds and insects in the wood. This was not recorded on the soundwalk on the World Listening Day, but the day after the 19th july. The WLD was rather windy so I want to include one recording with less surrounding wind in this collection, just to give an idea. The wind is really changing all the soundscape in the woods and surroundings.

some birdie caught on the way
This is the sound of the wind passing through rushes on top of St. Ninian's Isle. I was there walking with my friends Lisa and Kait, when I espied a big clump of rushes and instantly wanted to hear what it sounded like up close. I rushed over and buried my Naiant X-X omni-directionals deep into the leaves, then sat back and listened with my own ears to the lovely textures of those plants being stirred by the wind. It's hard to record the wind directly, but I like how you can hear it indirectly here, in the shuffle and abrading of thick green leaves moving together under its force. I love how the gusts - the swell and decay of the wind - are also somehow evident here in the way it is teasing the rushes. You can also hear in the recording some small drifts of conversation - more a sound than individual words - from Kait and Lisa, who were sat further up the hill from me, waiting for me. It was a beautiful Sunday evening, and there were sheep all around us. Lisa was trying to photograph them, while I was trying to document some aspects of the sonic textures that surround them where they graze in this maritime context. I think they were actually Suffolks and not Shetland sheep, so these sounds are perhaps not strictly speaking directly related to woollen industries, (Suffolks are grown more for meat in general) but I think there is something amazing in being able to hear reeds/rushes/the ocean roar/seabirds so close to where sheep are grazing. The proximity of farmland and sea is quite particular to Shetland, and defines the conditions for a crofting lifestyle in which knitwear and fish were historically the main currencies produced on each croft. In this recording I like to think that you can hear how the soil and the sea sit beside each other where sheep graze, both swept by the wind and cruised by seabirds.

right before leaving Polcyn, spring birds mixed beautifully with human voices & passing cars on the still frozen over parking lot
This recording was made in a place called Las Puntas, just in the entrance of the smallest hostel in the world. There we can find a “bufadero”. Is a hole in the volcanic ground throw which the wind, pushed by the waves of the ocean, blows.

Sinlahekin Valley is the heart of the Sinlahekin Wildlife Area, a large unit managed by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. A mixture of ranch land, managed big-game area, protected wildlife refuge, and dedicated recreation area, Sinlahekin is a beautiful, bio-diverse and extremely habitat diverse region protected from human over-run more from remoteness than anything else.<br />The valley itself is a 16 mile long, 1/2-mile wide glacier-dug trench near the Northeastern slope of the Cascades. With steep valley walls reaching up to 1600 ft, the Western side is deeply influenced and firmly a part of the Cascades' slope. With steep soaring cliffs, high-spilling waterfalls, rocky outcroppings, it feels much more "mountain" than the other side. The Eastern side has much more rolling slopes, more open meadow and field area.<br />The slops and high areas of either side of the valley are populated by bighorn sheep and marmots, as well as other upland wildlife and game birds. The valley floor, where I spent most of my time, has a diverse mixture of migratory songbirds, waterfowl, resident Central Washington birds, and the ever-present Pacific Chorus Frogs that are a fixture of the Northwest Soundscape.<br />I was lucky on this visit to be there on days with almost no wind. A gentle breeze blew through from time to time, but for the exception of one dusk blow-through the air was still the entire time.<br />One signature of this visit was distant water spillage. I'm told that normally at this time of the year the cascade spills have flushed to a drizzle and the creeks and marsh ponds of the valley have peaked and are on their downflow. However, as we now know this past winter was an incredible anomaly, setting record rain and snow fall throughout the Northwest. Cascade spills are still shooting over the western wall of the valley. The spring-fed creek that lazily winds through the valley is surging at nearly 20 its normal flow. Ponds have tiny green islands that are actually the tops of the trees that ring the normal shore.<br />I've not filtered any of the water wash in this recording. I don't like doing that.<br />errata:<br />recording technique: Double Mid-Side (Sennheiser MKH8040/MKH30/MKH8040) down mixed to stereo<br />Temperature: 65º at start<br />recording crosses sunrise (5:09) at midpoint<br />clear skies, low wind, generally a Nice Day

"Half-hidden in Singapore, the Bukit Brown cemetery is a sprawling ground of greenery and heavy gravestones. On many of the stones the miniature portraits are fading or faded, their names unrecognized and stories forgotten. <br /><br />But other graves are still visited by faithful relatives, bringing flowers and incense for their ancestors. Along the paths one finds joggers and children riding horses in a rare space of untouched nature.<br /><br />At around 200 hectares, the land on which the cemetery sits is a luxury for a city-state hungry for space. In 2011, the government announced plans for a dual four-lane road that would run through part of Bukit Brown. Construction would require the destruction and exhumation of 5,000 graves.<br /><br />Conservation groups such as SOS Bukit Brown and All Things Bukit Brown have come together to fight to preserve the cemetery. In October 2013, Bukit Brown was included in the 2014 World Monuments Watch list.<br /><br />But the government remains resolute. “[P]lanning for the long term in land-scarce Singapore does require us to make difficult trade-off decisions. We will have to continue to ensure that sufficient land is safeguarded island-wide, and find ways to make good use of our limited land in order to meet future demand for uses such as housing, industry and infrastructure,” a spokesperson of the Urban Redevelopment Authority told the press."<br /><br />http://thediplomat.com/2013/10/singapore-the-fight-to-save-bukit-brown/<br /><br />"The process of exhumation and highway planning had started in March 2012. The result will be the losing of 5000 graves, destroying the forest, bio-diversity, global warming and other environmental impacts like the risk of flooding."<br /><br />http://sosbukitbrown.wordpress.com/<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />//////////////////////<br />Recordist : Stéphane MARIN<br />//////////////////////<br />ZOOM H4n built-in rec.<br />//////////////////////<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />//////////////////////<br />This phonography was recorded for the project<br />"An Umbrella for 2" <br />at the occasion of <br />Singapore Arts Festival 2012<br />//////////////////////<br />http://www.espaces-sonores.com/#!an-umbrella-for-2/c1qg7<br />//////////////////////<br />Cette phonographie a été enregistrée <br />pour le spectacle "Un Pépin pour 2" <br />à l'occasion du<br />Singapore Arts Festival en 2012<br />//////////////////////<br />http://www.espaces-sonores.com/#!un-ppin-pour-2/c111t<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />//////////////////////<br />© Espaces Sonores<br />//////////////////////<br />http://www.espaces-sonores.com/<br />//////////////////////<br />https://soundcloud.com/espaces-sonores<br />//////////////////////<br />http://espaces--sonores.bandcamp.com/<br />//////////////////////<br />https://www.facebook.com/ESPASON<br />//////////////////////<br />https://twitter.com/espaces_sonores<br />//////////////////////
This is the sound of my friend's windchimes, and the lovely situation of us, and her Guide/Assistance Dog hanging out in the garden and listening to them. This is a quiet neighbourhood on the outskirts of Carrick, so you can just hear a bit of someone digging nearby, the birds in the trees and the swelling of the wind as it passes over. We shared some nice moments standing there, my friend smoking, the chimes chiming, the dog sniffing the recorder, and the sunshine shining, with just the tiniest chill in the air. Beautiful sounds, sorry for the bit of wind distortion here and there in the recording.

Parque do Ibirapuera is one of the biggest parks in São Paulo. Even in the morning, a lot of people were jogging around there and a few were taking their dog for a walk.

(PL) Segiet. Nad urwiskiem przy wyrobisku kopalni dolomitu. Odgłosy świętowania Nowego Roku dochodzą głównie z bardzo daleka i z wielu miejsc na raz. W najbliższym otoczeniu nie ma dużo domów i prawie nikt nie strzela. Z kolei las ucichł i przeczekuje.<br />Utwór jest wycinkiem z półtoragodzinnego nagrania. Większość czasu wybuchy są pojedyncze lub w małych seriach i z oddali. Dopiero dwie lub trzy minuty po północy wszyscy się przyłączają. Najintensywniejsze strzelanie trwa około kwadransa. Następnie dostrzeliwane są niedobitki z coraz mniejszą częstotliwością i zaangażowaniem i coraz bardziej z oddali.<br />======<br />(EN) Segiet. At the edge of the dolomite mine excavation. The sounds of New Year celebrations are heard mainly from far away and from all around. In the closest vicinity there are not that many houses and hardly anyone shoots fireworks. The forest waits all this out silently.<br />The piece is an excerpt of an hour-and-a-half-long recording. Most of the time the explosions are single or in short bursts and heard from afar. Only around two or three minutes after midnight everyone seems to join in. Most intense shooting lasts around fifteen minutes. Afterwards the leftovers are fired, less and less frequently, with decreasing commitment, from further and further away.<br />RECORDED USING: Zoom H5, AT BP4025

Along with the occasional police siren. Recorded with my trusty Edirol R-09.

(PL) Spędziłem półtorej godziny nasłuchując w swoim stałym miejscu w Segiecie. Los mi sprzyjał i udało mi się wykroić taki to spokojny, ciekawy fragment, którym mogę się tu podzielić.<br />Dzień był przyjemny, wietrzny i słoneczny, a przed wejściem do rezerwatu zaparkowane było mnóstwo samochodów. Na szczęście zwalony buk, przy którym siadam jest na mało uczęszczanej ścieżce.<br />Las dziś jakby spał, ptaki trzymały się na dystans. Tylko suche liście szeleściły, a gałęzie w koronach młodych buków obijały się o siebie nawzajem przy podmuchach wiatru.<br />(EN) I have spent an hour and a half listening at my usual spot in Segiet. I was lucky and have been able to cut out this peaceful, interesting piece that I can share here.<br />It was a pleasant, windy, sunny day and there were plenty of cars parked outside the nature reserve. Luckilly the path where I sit by the fallen beech tree is visited rarely by other people.<br />The forest seemed to be asleep, the birds kept their distance. Only dry leaves rustled and upper branches of the young beeches banged on each other in gusts of wind.<br />Zoom F4, AT BP4025

Neulaniemi is a well known forest-hiking-cottage- area near Kuopio, this place is about 7 km from the city centre (Kuopio marketplace) at our summer cottage. This recording is done with a small talkie-recorder on 6 m height on a bush-tree. The first to sing here was a "Lehtokurppa"(in finnish). There is noise from traffic, wind and the recorder itself, f.ec. a taxi bringing someone to cottage since it was saturday-sunday night. The motor-higway is only 4 km away and the noise travels also from the north side of the town, because of Lake-Kallavesi, which hereby is still frozen. The night was cold, under freezing point, some -1 -15 °C. Typical small birds, for whom I have 6-7 home-boxes nearby and some bigger white fishing-birds. Hope you like this. PS. The area is on a threat to be builded full of houses for 6.000 inhabitants. We do not like that, but the town council does not hear us. Familiar?

Grootbroek is a swamp and a pond, located in Sint-Agatha-Rode and Sint-Joris-Weert. I immediately thought that the place must be charming : all that life abounding in the swamps ! I was wrong. Indeed many birds were present on the pond, but another kind of bird was there : the plane. This place is absolutely drowned by the Zaventem takeoffs. I went there very early on the morning only for Grootbroek. I said to myself : do I leave immediately ? No, I must talk about this horror, the great nature and the carnage airport. Ornithologists have to know it, the main volatile here is the plane. Sounds on the pond : Canada geese, Mallard ducks, Kingfisher, Waterfowl, Common Moorhen, Eurasian Coot, Mute swans. On the woods : Common Chiffchaff, Common Chaffinch, Common Blackbird. There's an unknown bird, very near each time, probably a Meadow Pipit.
leaving my mics after a nice afternoon walk in the intense heat, after being attacked by hundreds of mosquitoes in the dry tropical vine forest which was also filled with beautiful giant butterflies. on the walk back at night i almost stepped on a death adder (one of the most venomous snakes in the world), fortunately not aggressive, but they are an ambush predator so they don't move! i had to walk around the track through thick, vine-y, thorny forest on a thin ledge which looked over a dry creek about 10 metres below and then came across a big stag beetle. it was a good night.<br />in this dusk recording the most frequent birds are friarbirds, currawongs, cockatoo's and kookaburra's. i don't know the insects.

‘Kaapse klopse’ or Cape Town Minstrel Carnival takes place on 2 January every year. The origin of the carnival stretches back to the 19th century and has its origins in the time of slavery in Cape Town, when the original citizens of District Six were allowed their one day off for New years day.<br /><br />The event, which has developed a distinct Cape flavour, is also supposed to have ties to the minstrel entertainers who stopped off in Cape Town on huge American ocean liners, over 100 years ago.<br /><br />Over ten thousand costumed, banjo-picking musicians and dancers, their faces painted white, as opposed to the original black-painted faces of the visiting minstrels, parade and march through the streets, followed by a series of dance, singing and costume competitions at Green Point Stadium.

Your common or garden House Sparrows are now having a bit of a hard time in the UK as so many people have decked their gardens, or generally 'tidied-up' too much, thus depriving these loveable little birds of not only their natural food sources but a lovely bit of bare ground to have a dust bath in, to get rid of all those pesky parasites. I have put up 12 nest boxes on the back of my house, either side of a second storey sash window and at the moment 11 are occupied. This recording is made using two lavalier mics (Sony 77bs) into a Sony M10, placed either side of the exterior windowsill, this is not ideal as there is a 'gap' in the stereo image as you will hear,......

Recording of the birds into the urban woods of Belgium. The reality is that there's no real forest in Belgium, it's only trees, grass, leaves : in a nutshell, these objects scattered in an extremely urbanized landfield. Because of this pressure, pollution is considerable : the cars, the trains, but also and especially the intolerable airplanes. It's interesting to record the Belgian forest, as a sonic testimony of aggression on the natural environment. This explains why this sound is called "the woods" rather than "the forest".<br /><br />Birds are the  European Robin, the Great Spotted Woodpecker, and the regular chip-chip-chip-chip are very young Great Spotted Woodpecker.

awake of the city. this is a general soundscape of every awake, no surprise: birds.
Recorded on Zoom H4n, build in microphones.
early morning forest ambience of the Morasko nature reserve. due to early hour there is not much impact of the local traffic. the diversity of bird calls is amazing. some of the calls can be heard only around this hour.
What better way to relax after the walk around Aphrodite's Trail with extraordinary views, giant and 500 year old trees and the panorama from Mutti tis Sotiras? A short, immersive (not literally, sadly) moment of listening to the polyphony of watery sounds in the natural fissure and cave that is the bath place of Aphrodite. An extraordinary complex sound scene with drips and flows, close by and resonating along with a distant but very definite conversation between two birds (pigeons?) maybe the souls of Aphrodite and Adonis? I used a pair of Roland binaural mics on either side of the branch of a tree that looked directly into the bathing place to an Olympus (how appropriate) LS5
it wasn't possible to record while standing still due to swarms of mosquitoes and other bugs. so forest ambience recorded while working fast and swinging arms to distract the creatures.

My Mum was heading up to Leura in the Blue Mountains to go to a meditation retreat for about 6 hours so I thought I would come up with her and go for a bit of a bush walk near where she was staying. It was a warm, rainy day, sometimes drizzling hard and other times dry but still very overcast for 20-40 minutes. In this recording you can hear some crickets, along with some Honeyeaters, Crimson Rosella's, Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoos, a few other birds and the odd froglet calling. You can also hear water gushing from a little gully down below where I was recording. At one point you hear footsteps because I came back to stop the recording, but then decided I might like to leave it recording for a bit longer so walked away again. Very peaceful place to be.<br />Recorded with a pair of AT4022's into a Tascam DR-680.

a spring-like, late winter afternoon in a suburban environment, framed by a major road link and, conflictingly, a strip of river adjacent to quite some greenery. the great tit is chirping prominently in the foreground whereas an array of other birds, primarily finches i believe, create a background ambiance overlaying the fainter traffic noise from the nearby road.<br /><br />the recording has been made with a directional condenser stereo mic using the roland R-05 recorder. original format properties: wav 96.0khz/24bit

I wanted to listen to the rhythm of the sea off the coast of St. Ninian's Isle, so I waded into the ocean up to my waist trailing my hydrophones around me. The tide was quite gentle, but nevertheless tugged my hydrophones around quite a bit, and you can hear the approach and exit of each wave, as well as the nice grainy sound of the sand as it is churned up underneath by the swell. Recorded with Jez Riley French hydrophones and FOSTEX FR-2LE.

A general atmosphere of various birds calling and singing in the half-light of late night at the edge of a large piece of open ground. I often think it is like going back in time as I can hardly think of anywhere else that has such a soundscape. I imagine it would have been commonly like this in times past. Soomaa is amazing, it was hard to count all the Corncrakes and Thrush Nightingales in that place. Equipment; A pair of Sennheiser MKH8020 microphones, a Sound Devices microphone pre-amp and a Marantz PMD661 solid state recorder.

I was on my way to work when I noticed the sound of a Woodpecker up in the trees above the high wall to my left. Leant against the wall and listened to the woodpecker, then noticed that on the other side of the path, beyond the fence, someone was doing some sort of DIY. So you can hear on the one side the woodpecker and on the other side of the path, occasional hammerings and saw-rippings. You can also hear distantly the traffic of London Road; Crows; many other birds; and the occasional cyclist or walker using that path. It is a great path and I love walking on it. Often hear Robins, too.

Lake gulls and other birds responding to my presence along perimeter of restricted, "unstable ground". Note fan shaped land mass extending out into Lake Michigan. I was interested in the sensors at this site, installed by the USGS to measure erosional effects and another, by the Department of Energy to detect radiation in the event of a leak of radioactive particles from the two nuclear power plants along the shoreline. One of these, the Kewaunee Plant was taken offline on May 7 2013, and will continue to cool for years to come. Like silent sentinels, sensor arrays like these monitor our world for us.

This is one of my favourite places to come to meditate. No recording, even with much better and sensitive equipment could really capture the ambiance of this place. Just sitting there, one these cliffs that stick out of the edge of this mini-mountain slope, surrounded by forest, over-looking the grasslands below and the vast Pacific ocean beyond it. And the quiet there.. it is probably my favourite local place to go. Beyond beautiful :) In this recording you can hear the quiet of the forest with a male Superb Lyrebird singing in the background with the distance waves crashing into the coast.<br />Recorded with an Olympus LS-5.

the Golden Mount in central bangkok is lined with hundreds of bells and gongs of all sizes and shapes. many are wind chimes with beautiful metal leaves attached to their strikers which ring wonderfully in the slightest breeze. others are struck by the worshipers whilst walking past joined by enormous gongs along the way. all this, at times, turns the silence and serenity of this place into a big ocean of fantastic metallic sounds. an amazing soundscape.... i used the Roland R-05 field recorder and the appendant Roland CS-10EM binaural microphones for this recording.

Belgian woods are not forests. It's an accumulation of trees. Inside run deep paths. You will find here shouting cyclists and noisy walkers. Above, it's an uninterrupted flight of take-off and landings. Downstairs is a tourist site: the Aulne abbey. An old vehicles parade makes a devil noise on the cobblestones. On the right is the village of Landelies. Sunday morning is a fine day today. A motorcycle concentration occupies the roads. At the top is Montigny-Le-Tilleul. Strident ambulances tear apart the soundscape. Belgium is that. It's nothing more than a gigantic pile of noise pollution, whatever the time whatever the day.<br /><br />A moment, you have to mourn. The forest in Belgium no longer exists. These recordings made in the woods concentrate three hours of intense fighting, trying to convince oneself that something is still possible. Something is still possible ?<br /><br />Common Chaffinch, lot of juvenile Great Tit, Blackbird.

The sounds of the morning after a long night of loud summer frog chorus's. It was very misty this morning and the humidity would have been around 98-99%, it was around 17-18c which is quite cool for a clear summer morning but down in the valley by the river it usually a few degrees cooler than in the suburbs. The dominant birds calling are Sulphur-crested Cockatoo's (Cacatua galerita) which you can hear screaming throughout the recording, as well occasional wails from Australian Ravens (Corvus coronoides). Lots of plane and traffic noise present too.<br />Recorded with a pair of AT4022's into a Tascam DR-680.<br />Some photo's here: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10202577444797616&set=pcb.10202577447757690&type=1&theater

This kind of nightlife is more lively and frenzied than the one in a city club. Snippet of a sound landscape recorded in our house near el Toro Negro forest in Puerto Rico, where we could hear the deafening, yet luscious and vivid sounds of many insects, birds and frogs among unidentified buzz of distant activity. <br /><br />In Puerto Rico frogs receive the onomatopoeic name of “coqui” because their sound resembles more the chirping and singing that birds usually do. Their call is composed by two syllables: deeper [koo] to put off other males and mark their territory, and higher [kee] to attract females (Narins, P. and Capranica, R. 1976. Sexual differences in the auditory system of the tree frog Eleutherodactylus coqui. Science, 192(4237), pp.378-380). Reaching up to 95dB from 3 feet away, the species heard in this recording is Eleutherodactylus coqui, arguably one of the loudest frogs in the world (Narins, P. 1995. Frog Communication. Scientific American, 273(2), pp.78-83). <br /><br />I was surrounded by bugs, maybe because they liked the sweet smell of the coconut shampoo I had just used. There was a lot of fireflies around too, but I’m not sure if they make any audible sound. <br /><br />Recorded with a Zoom iQ6.

(EN) Windless Sunday of winter solstice in Segiet. There was a bit of fog and it was quiet when I got there. Since it was the shortest day of the year, it had to get dark soon - sunset was at 15:43. Once it got darker, more things started to happen around me in the forest. I started to hear birds (tawny owls) and deer walking around. All that still very quiet and careful.<br />Once I finished my recording and walked throug the dark forest, I walked out int owell lit and vibrant man-made world, into traffic and shops. It's a weird feeling to walk out of the night back into early evening.<br />recorded with Zoom F4, AT BP4025<br />(PL) Bezwietrzna niedziela przesilenia zimowego w Segiecie. W powietrzu unosiła się lekka mgła i było cicho, kiedy doszedłem na miejsce. W najkrótszy dzień roku musiało szybko zrobić się ciemno - zachód słońca był o 15:43. Jak tylko zrobiło się szaro, w lesie zaczęło się więcej dziać. Odezwały się ptaki (puszczyki) i zaczęły krążyć sarny. Wszystko to nadal bardzo cicho i ostrożnie.<br />Po skończonej sesji nagraniowej i spacerze przez ciemny las wszedłem z powrotem w rozświetlony i tętniący życiem świat ludzi, w ruch uliczny i sklepy. To dziwne uczucie, tak wyjść z nocy z powrotem we wczesny wieczór.<br />Zarejestrowane przy użyciu Zoom F4, AT BP4025

I've never been here before, though it's close. I've seen the landscape while departing with a plane from the nearby Berlin Schönefeld airport. It was a bright early spring morning, the view from above on these patches of forests, lakes and river-side areas was promising, deep and and touching. So I went there, and fou nd it. And it was a sonic disappointment. Even on Sundays there's no quietness, planes lift of frequently, a carpet of noise lies over the land, the deep rumbling of engines can always be heard, long after the planes moved ahead, taking me away, on this bright day in early spring.<br /><br />(SD702, NT1A)

While walking back from the coast I found a path which led away from the coast and went deeper in the forest. The path was quite steep and went down into a valley covered in lush rainforest. Within the rainforest I came across an ancient tree which had survived the logging which happened in the 19th/early 20th centuries, this tree towered over the others. As I walked along the forest I came across another tree, which was groaning like an Elephant.<br />While I was recording this tree I walked around the forest looking for a place to get one last overnight recording and was bitten above my left knee by a spider so headed back quickly to retrieve my mics. Fortunately the spider bite only made me become mildly delirious for a short amount of time as well has becoming very itchy for a days afterwards! <br />Recorded on my last day in Murramarang, my 23rd birthday, with a pair of AT4022's into a Tascam DR-680.

"Half-hidden in Singapore, the Bukit Brown cemetery is a sprawling ground of greenery and heavy gravestones. On many of the stones the miniature portraits are fading or faded, their names unrecognized and stories forgotten. <br /><br />But other graves are still visited by faithful relatives, bringing flowers and incense for their ancestors. Along the paths one finds joggers and children riding horses in a rare space of untouched nature.<br /><br />At around 200 hectares, the land on which the cemetery sits is a luxury for a city-state hungry for space. In 2011, the government announced plans for a dual four-lane road that would run through part of Bukit Brown. Construction would require the destruction and exhumation of 5,000 graves.<br /><br />Conservation groups such as SOS Bukit Brown and All Things Bukit Brown have come together to fight to preserve the cemetery. In October 2013, Bukit Brown was included in the 2014 World Monuments Watch list.<br /><br />But the government remains resolute. “[P]lanning for the long term in land-scarce Singapore does require us to make difficult trade-off decisions. We will have to continue to ensure that sufficient land is safeguarded island-wide, and find ways to make good use of our limited land in order to meet future demand for uses such as housing, industry and infrastructure,” a spokesperson of the Urban Redevelopment Authority told the press."<br /><br />http://thediplomat.com/2013/10/singapore-the-fight-to-save-bukit-brown/<br /><br />"The process of exhumation and highway planning had started in March 2012. The result will be the losing of 5000 graves, destroying the forest, bio-diversity, global warming and other environmental impacts like the risk of flooding."<br /><br />http://sosbukitbrown.wordpress.com/<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />//////////////////////<br />Recordist : Stéphane MARIN<br />//////////////////////<br />ZOOM H4n built-in rec.<br />//////////////////////<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />//////////////////////<br />This phonography was recorded for the project<br />"An Umbrella for 2" <br />at the occasion of <br />Singapore Arts Festival 2012<br />//////////////////////<br />http://www.espaces-sonores.com/#!an-umbrella-for-2/c1qg7<br />//////////////////////<br />Cette phonographie a été enregistrée <br />pour le spectacle "Un Pépin pour 2" <br />à l'occasion du<br />Singapore Arts Festival en 2012<br />//////////////////////<br />http://www.espaces-sonores.com/#!un-ppin-pour-2/c111t<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />//////////////////////<br />© Espaces Sonores<br />//////////////////////<br />http://www.espaces-sonores.com/<br />//////////////////////<br />https://soundcloud.com/espaces-sonores<br />//////////////////////<br />http://espaces--sonores.bandcamp.com/<br />//////////////////////<br />https://www.facebook.com/ESPASON<br />//////////////////////<br />https://twitter.com/espaces_sonores<br />//////////////////////

Over 8000 cows live inside the sheds here at the Tidy View Dairy farm, the largest of many industrial milk factories in Wisconsin, a state rich in protein. Windstorm rattled cages, ventilation turbines... upset the herd, startled birds... The stench of all that manure and fermenting silage is powerful enough miles away. Imagine what the cows inside these sheds have to put up with night and day. This is NOT a free range farm.

There was a series of electrical storms just off the coast tonight, looming over garden island, and south to Kwinana. I jumped in the car and headed down to the water to catch some better views of the storm, and I waited for it to get close enough to hear. The rain on the roof is the very edge of the storm and the ocean was just flashing from about 5 strikes a minute, 180 degrees around me. Recorded from inside my car, with the window down. The wind noise is the sound of the wind whipping through the door frame. I was getting pretty wet with the window down, but it provided the best sound. Thanks to Zak for the company while recording this, Recorded on a Zoom H2N, Zoom windshield, with ATH-M40x headphones.

The first Sunday in May is International Dawn Chorus Day. Despite it being rainy I decided to go to Segiet and broadcast the surrounding souds live as part of the Reveil2019.

the recording was made on 12th of may (2012) in the evening hours, simply with a Zoom H4n. the place is located hillside over the labe/elbe river. trains passing the valley near Decin can be heard several minutes in advance, depending on the circumstances even up to almost 10 minutes (especially trains coming from the north direction). If you listen intently you can hear the certain filtering of the different meanders of the labe/elbe since the railway leads exactly along the river through the mountains. included other sounds: people talking nearby, dog (grisha) barking, no birds singing but airplane passing, ...<br />Unfortunately I can't contribute a longer recording due to the bad wind protection I had at my disposal that day.

This recording was taken in my backyard at my house in Isla Vista. To record this sound I held the recorder high up off the cliff and over the ocean. This was recorded at 8:30 pm in order to hear the waves crash against the cliff, if you listen carefully you can even hear my roommates in our living room talking to each other. This represents the sound of a relaxing and "chill" night in IV listening to the waves with your housemates after a long day of school.

The Moorlinse Buch is a natural water body in the Berlin district Buch in the district Pankow in the lowland of the Panke. It was formed in the 1990s by filling a depression with groundwater and stratified water.<br /><br />According to old property maps from the 18th and 19th centuries, the area was originally a wet meadow. This was dried up by the establishment of the Berlin sewage fields at the end of the 19th century and because of the intensive agriculture in the surroundings since the 1950s.<br /><br />As a breeding ground for almost all local waterfowl species, it became a popular observation site for ornithologists.

Near a pond, the song of a Common Chiffchaff, a very common bird here. It's a lovely bird singing during spring and summer times. You can also hear a pony hardly coughing three times, and at the backyard, these birds [french name and english name] :<br />Pouillot véloce (Common Chiffchaff) - tou tou ti tou tou ti<br />Merle (Blackbird)<br />Poule d'eau (Common Moorhen)<br />Colvert (Mallard)<br />Buse variable (Common Buzzard)<br />Corneille (Carrion Crow).

Revisiting one of my favorite forests in winter. As you can see from the satellite image they don't manage the vegetation here so the feeling is a little more "wild" than the surrounding industrial forests.

a very multifacetted concert by birds in the early morning
A man was feeding lots of birds, mainly gulls, mallards and coots. Traffic on the background and sometimes people passes. Recorded with Zoom H2n (Mid/Side recording).
This is the second time I put a recorder in this wood. As it's private, nobody is going here. Crows and jackdaws live on an elevated tree. Every evening, quite early, these birds talk about their day. I put a recorder, hidden, on an abandoned trunk. There's less cars than yesterday as everybody is sleeping after the too fat Christmas repast. It was the quite only and last chance to record the birds. Unfortunately, a long painful plane... This is the crows war, every early evening in winter it's like that. There's no other moment as this in daylight times, groups are dislocated in the fields, essentially to find food.
Recordist: Liviu Ispas<br />Description: In the central plaza. Tourists talking, birds, bikes and cars passing by. Recorded with ZOOM H2N Handy Recorder.

This was recorded shortly before dusk (I don't recall the exact time of day) on the north shore of Hog Island. Countless numbers of cormorants (along with seagulls and some other small ocean birds) were perched in the leafless trees on the island. I'm recording from below the islands rock, on the sandy shore, mic facing up at the birds. There was a massive amount of bird droppings and you could hear/see some of them splatting against the rock (though i'm not sure I could pick them out in this recording). This was recorded on my Zoom H4n. Note: This is the first field recording I've edited and shared, so I hope it is up to snuff.

My original idea was to get into the forest, away from the road to record the dawn chorus but I ended up starting my walk too late and dawn started before I was even close to trail. So I decided I may as well record it from the road rather than not record it at all. Occasionally early morning bicycle riders go past.<br />One of the notable callers are a group of Satin Bowerbirds with their odd whistling calls and occasional other more science fiction-y sounds.<br />Recorded with an Olympus LS-5.<br /><br />https://soundcloud.com/jeremyhegge<br />https://jeremyh.bandcamp.com

This is the sound of the N11 motorway and the birds in the trees, at the site where a road-protest was once en-camped. You can hear the traffic, the stream has dried up at this place (though it is still burbling away further down the valley). This was once a place where people gathered in 1997 live in and protect the nature reserve from a road-expansion project. Recorded with the EDIROL R09, sat at a picnic bench, listening to dog-walkers leaving in their cars, to the traffic on the main road, and the quietness of the trees themselves.

All over Shetland people still have peat cutting rights. If you look at the satellite image of this landscape, you can see dark lines running off the track; these are strips of land which have been cut back to reveal the young coal beneath. This is annually harvested in small quantities and used as a domestic fuel to heat the home throughout winter. There are many historic images of Shetland women walking with large keshies on their backs, filled with cut peats, and knitting as they walk; I was interested in listening to the labour associated with the peat harvest, and Laurie's mother, Ingrid, kindly agreed to cut some peat for me so I could hear how this work sounds. This is the wrong time of year to cut peat, as the ground is dry. Normally the work is done in May, when the winter rains have wet the earth through, and when the birds are very much noisier than they are here in this recording! However in spite of these inaccuracies, in this recording you can still hear the graft involved in cutting into the ground, moving the heavy sods across and placing them on the ground (where they will regenerate) and cutting into the freshly exposed peat with a tusker. I kept our chatter in the recording, because although you can't hear everything we say very well (the microphones were on the ground, close to where Ingrid was cutting) the snippets which are captured give some context to the sounds. Recorded with Naiant X-X microphones and FOSTEX FR-2LE.

Process is simple. I was walking in the Lauzelle forest. I found the place uninteresting mainly because of the quite crowded people here, and also the motorway far distant noise. But, wind in the trees was beautiful. I encontered an horse and... a big dung fall onto the ground. The flies went immedialtly on it. I put the two microphones into the hot poop and all was made, that's all I can say. It's like that, on a hot and lazy public holiday, walkers saw a stupid guy recording a dung during an hour !

This recording was made in the swamp area called Padule di Fucecchio (Tuscany, Italy). It is a large marsh where many different species of birds reproduce or pass by during migrations.<br />Each time of the year has a different soundscape, according to the species found.<br />It is an hi-fi soundscape with a very low noise level, very difficult to find in an urbanized area like the one surrounding the swamp itself.

"Half-hidden in Singapore, the Bukit Brown cemetery is a sprawling ground of greenery and heavy gravestones. On many of the stones the miniature portraits are fading or faded, their names unrecognized and stories forgotten. <br /><br />But other graves are still visited by faithful relatives, bringing flowers and incense for their ancestors. Along the paths one finds joggers and children riding horses in a rare space of untouched nature.<br /><br />At around 200 hectares, the land on which the cemetery sits is a luxury for a city-state hungry for space. In 2011, the government announced plans for a dual four-lane road that would run through part of Bukit Brown. Construction would require the destruction and exhumation of 5,000 graves.<br /><br />Conservation groups such as SOS Bukit Brown and All Things Bukit Brown have come together to fight to preserve the cemetery. In October 2013, Bukit Brown was included in the 2014 World Monuments Watch list.<br /><br />But the government remains resolute. “[P]lanning for the long term in land-scarce Singapore does require us to make difficult trade-off decisions. We will have to continue to ensure that sufficient land is safeguarded island-wide, and find ways to make good use of our limited land in order to meet future demand for uses such as housing, industry and infrastructure,” a spokesperson of the Urban Redevelopment Authority told the press."<br /><br />http://thediplomat.com/2013/10/singapore-the-fight-to-save-bukit-brown/<br /><br />"The process of exhumation and highway planning had started in March 2012. The result will be the losing of 5000 graves, destroying the forest, bio-diversity, global warming and other environmental impacts like the risk of flooding."<br /><br />http://sosbukitbrown.wordpress.com/<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />//////////////////////<br />Recordist : Stéphane MARIN<br />//////////////////////<br />ZOOM H4n built-in rec.<br />//////////////////////<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />//////////////////////<br />This phonography was recorded for the project<br />"An Umbrella for 2" <br />at the occasion of <br />Singapore Arts Festival 2012<br />//////////////////////<br />http://www.espaces-sonores.com/#!an-umbrella-for-2/c1qg7<br />//////////////////////<br />Cette phonographie a été enregistrée <br />pour le spectacle "Un Pépin pour 2" <br />à l'occasion du<br />Singapore Arts Festival en 2012<br />//////////////////////<br />http://www.espaces-sonores.com/#!un-ppin-pour-2/c111t<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />//////////////////////<br />© Espaces Sonores<br />//////////////////////<br />http://www.espaces-sonores.com/<br />//////////////////////<br />https://soundcloud.com/espaces-sonores<br />//////////////////////<br />http://espaces--sonores.bandcamp.com/<br />//////////////////////<br />https://www.facebook.com/ESPASON<br />//////////////////////<br />https://twitter.com/espaces_sonores<br />//////////////////////

I went out to the Horniman Museum and Gardens - home to a 'sound garden' full of instruments for children (and many adults) to play on - to make a simple ambient recording. However, I met a little dog who I made the mistake of throwing a ball for just once, after which he wouldn't leave me alone to record and kept bringing the ball back to me rather than his owner, Sue. We had a lovely time.

A strong wind weather event swept across Estonia on the evening of December 18th. I left some mics in the forest nearby. I underestimated how loud it would be so you can hear the compressor of the LS-10 kick in during the heavier gusts. Fortunately not many trees were felled as the extreme wind event that swept across southern Estonia on October 27th. I wonder how common these events will become in the future?

I had noticed on several trips into town that of an evening a certain tree fills with roosting Starlings. The noise is quite amazing of these tiny birds, all gathering in the tree together. In Winter their collected voices offer a sonic brightness to countenance the dismal grey and early darkness of the evenings. To make this recording I stood underneath the tree, very still, listening to the birds congregating in this spot. You can hear also the buses that run past the church yard where the tree stands, and pedestrians walking on the paths that flank it. Recorded with the on board microphones of the EDIROL R-09.

We were walking towards The Royal Oak Pub in Fritham through a long stretch of wood in which we kept hearing this marvelous cuckoo. I just had the EDIROL R-09 with me, but was able to capture something of the bird's lovely song as it rang out between the trees. We stood very still to record the sound and at some point the cuckoo even moved into the tree that was closest to us. Beautiful sound.

Late Autumn, leaves have all fallen from the trees and form a soft bed on the ground that is now soaked from the strong rain 30 minutes ago.

A dog walks along, sometimes falling behind. There is a highway not so far that builds up a background sound. Recorded with Zoom H1n.

I'm no ornithologist, so I couldn't tell you what kind of birds these are but they looked not unlike gulls and there were hundreds of them - and others - along the cliffs here at Dunnet Head.

I returned to Drayton FC to listen to the A34 which - as expected - was in full voice. The curious thing is that this time it seemed to be all I could focus on whereas the last time I visited I also listened to the birds and extraneous sounds from the car park. The sound of the A34 saturates the soundscape. Recorded with a Sound Devices 722T and an AT BP4025.
Some cormorants and Canada goose are living on this small island, in the middle of the pond. On the morning when the sun is timidly awakening, these birds make a lot of noise.
I woke up to hear the lovely sound of birds outside in the trees. I opened the window, and then the sound of those birds mixed with the din of the fountain in the garden mingled together while I stood and listened. There was a pheasant too. Naiant X-X microphones with little windjammer furries, and Fostex FR-2LE

This recording was made by strapping my EDIROL R-09 onto the underside of a bird table with a cable tie. From there is picks up on the ceramic wind chimes that hang near the back door, the birdsong of the birds that hang out in a nearby Walnut tree and the surrounding hedges, the huge noise of planes passing on the flight path to Heathrow, some noises from vehicles on the nearby roads, a blackbird, and a general rumble of traffic. A couple of wood pigeons also sound in the recording, and there is a tapping sound, produced by the birds fetching seed off the table with their beaks.

while the journey between cronulla and bundeena is usually made with the ferry "m.v. curranulla", it was being maintained/repaired during the weekend so for the first time i made the trip on the "tom thumb III", a very old ferry with a much noisier engine and less internal/external space. <br />although it was quite cold outside, i stood out there to take in the lovely fresh air, the abstract, almost psychedelic visions in the dark water as we rode along the ocean and the sounds of the booming engine. the mics were placed on the floor which mainly captured the engine, but standing up as i was, you could hear the gushing of the water as the ferry tunneled through it.
Into the Fagne forest, birds waking up. The word Fagne comes from the Walloon language, and means swampy ground. Everything here is Sphagnum, it's very damp.

(PL) Niedziela, wieczór. Już dawno jest ciemno, nikt nie spaceruje w lesie, w rezerwacie. Wiatr może szarpać drzewa i nikt nie będzie się skarżył.<br />Nie mogłem przepuścić takiej okazji. Spakowałem potrzebny sprzęt i wybrałem się do lasu. Znalazłem osłonięte od wiatru miejsce w zapadlisku i nasłuchiwałem. Słychać wiatr w świerkach i bukach. Na ziemi wokół tańczą suche liście.<br />Nagranie zrealizowane przy użyciu Zoom F4, AT BP4025<br />(EN) Sunday evening. It's late and dark and noone is strolling in the forest, in nature reserve.

During their autumn migration northern Europe's cranes gather in hundreds of thousands at Linum to feed up before continuing their journey southwards. They are an amazing sight. Punctually, at dusk, flocks of up to 50 birds pass overhead in ever evolving formations trumpeting as they go. The Berlin/Hamburg motorway is a kilometer away and Tegel airport nearby. The weather on this evening was rainy and yellowing poplar leaves were hissing in the wind. These are the sound sources for this track, which is 3 consecutive recording edited together.

During the winter period, waterfowl were hungry. Intrigued by their presence in large numbers on the waters of the Lake Le Rondeau, near the Rambouillet castle, I recorded their songs for an uninterrupted hour. Since they were hungry, they solicited all the walkers. We hear them a lot. The recording is quiet on this new year day and really provokes the sound of a lullaby.<br /><br />We can hear : Mallard duck, Canada goose, Eurasian Coot, Domestic goose, Blackhead gull, Homo sapiens.
I took an afternoon walk. Attempted to walk the whole trail but got lost. Recording on the "forest road" by Dialogue on the start of my trip.

recording under the bridge between massive concrete pillars. plenty of piegons living there. you can hear their chirps and wing flaps bouncing of the sides of the pillars. at one point one of the birds drops a big piece of bread into the river. it's a busy part of town so there are a lot of sounds of traffic on the bridge. a group of teenagers walking on the bridge listening to hiphop on a portable speaker. The way the music reverberated under the bridge is vey interesting. (Roland R-07 internal mics)

I have recently discovered a beautiful pocket of woodland at the fringes of the Harris Gardens in the grounds of Reading University and I wanted to go there to listen to the sounds of the birds who are all very busily chirruping away just now with their babies and their nests. I found a nice clearing, resonant with the songs of birds, but then became aware of something – amplified through my microphones – high up and high pitched in the trees. Luckily I was recording using Chris-Watson’s pro-tip to attach two omni-directional microphones to a coathanger. This gives you a lovely stereo impression of ambient sound, but it also means that when you hear a difficult-to-access sound that is high up, you can wedge your coathanger on a stick and poke it up to the source. That is what I did, standing in a clearing still and near to a tree, watched over by two anxious woodpeckers. I think this sound is what I heard – the sound of their babies in a nest inside the tree. Isn’t it amazing? I love it when the process of recording a sound highlights something I had not previously heard – once I’ve heard it through the headphones, it’s there forever in the soundscape.

a bunch of tall trees, mainly birch, swayed severely in the wind producing beautiful, intricate noise. a few birds were able to break through with their chirps but other than that the hiss was overwhelming the sound scape. no processing was done to the recording except 80Hz LPF turned on in the recorder in order to prevent wind blasts.
Into the abandoned and literally pulverized Haumont bunker, a large colony of crows keeps an eye on the babies on the nests. Birds are very unhappy I'm here. During a small storm, with a very unfriendly neighborhood, a completely destroyed bunker and all this crows, I just find the place oppressive.

Originally wanted to record muffled sounds of a radio playing in a parked car. You can hear a bit a the beginning of the recording. But the traffic was heavy and the person left the car anyway. Kept recording for a minutes. Mainly cars passing by, a few strollers. All of the sudden a vintage car appeared from a forest road - chugging engine and a weird horn. (sony d50)

During a contingency day in Mexico, car or motorised vehicles are not supposed to be so many ! But as it has been possible to listen, motorized vehicles were there! <br />That could seem very strange to cut trees during a pollution alert in Mexico. One can have the feeling that nature will disappear with such kind of local habits! Actually people must be reminded that 40 years ago, before cars invaded the south of Mexico city, the place was occupied by trees, birds and cows! Xochimilco ecological zone is not too far from this place! <br />What I found, listening the city this day of may, was the feeling that motorized noises will not be in place for centuries. Broken tree branch noises, birds that we can listened from time to time are a clear message than resilience is not an abstract concept. Colibri are still leaving in this noisy and polluted city. Obviously human pressure is a high threat for many species but as we can listen here, trees are still growing (it was really needed to cut tree branchs before the earthquake in September 2017 to protect people). Few animals are able to survive our destructive way of life. But few is not nothing. Here, birds, dogs, humans struggle to be heard. We are not better positioned than other species.<br />Maybe, this is a recording of a specie that probable should disappear... the humans. Maybe sounds are not what we think they are, depending on the timescale interpretations change.

In this private wood, nobody is going and crows are living. Every evening, they talk about their day, it makes very noisy screams you can hear every winter early on the evening (something like 5 PM). I put a microphone in the forest and went alone in the kindergarden just near. At the beginning of the recording, a blackbird sing very near the recorder. A plane is passing by and after, the crows make war, as every evening. This is christmas and there's a lot of cars driving the small street called rue Thiers.
Hornby Island is well known for its healthy bald eagle population and the "eagle nest cam" which has attracted a lot of online attention. This recording was made in early morning on the rocky flats of Little Tribune Bay, focusing on two adult eagles sitting in the scraggly bare branches of a tall pine tree on the cliffs above the rocks (with young nearby). At 0:15 we hear the eagles leave the tree and fly together, their wings producing a pronounced pitched tone. At 0:45 we hear their piercing calls traded back and forth. A fly zooms past the microphone at 0:57. Crows and other birds are also heard, against the background sound of the wind in the trees, and little trickles of water in the low tide zone.<br />Microphone: Telinga stereo parabolic<br />Recorder: Tascam DR-680mkII

The interview with the blackbird and swifts interrupted by sound check of some band nearby backyard of the house by knights in Školská street. By the way the house, builded in 1888 in new renaissance style, is very beautiful. There was a saloon and tavern downstairs. Today its used for Leica gallery. And there is Communication Space Školská 28 for various nonprofit cultural and artistic activities in former workshop for galvanizing metal. The backyard is one of sonic oases in centre of Prague. You can hear just singing of birds and some fragments of sounds from windows of the house and gallery. Unfortunately sometimes also parasite sounds from new sport club which is situated nearby.

I recorded this on my 23rd birthday, also my last day in Murramarang National Park. Throughout most of my stay in Murramurrang, it had been mostly warm, sunny and almost windless. The winds started picked up on the 1st of April, but dramatically changed around midday on the 2nd of April when after a fairly hot but overcast morning, the clouds rolled in and so did the wind, making the coastline become quite rough and sending reasonable winds through the canopy of the forest. <br />This was recorded in one of my favourite spots that I had come across, a patch of tall, lush forest that was near one of the beaches. Normally filled with bird song, the winds and clouds seemed to make most of them quiet, as they normally do.<br />AT4022's into a Tascam DR-680.

i wrote a piece about this recording on the invitation of paul whitty of the sonic arts research unit at oxford brookes university in the uk for a publication entitled 'get some chalk on your boots'. a little long maybe for an aporee description, but it seems appropriate to include it here:<br /><br />36,000 for Madrid: Recorded on the 14th of March, 2004 at White Hart Lane, before a match between Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United<br /><br />I was a bit ill that day, I recall. But a friend had invited me to White Hart Lane, and I had never been to a football match, not exactly being a sports fan myself. I decided to go, partly, although not exclusively, because it gave me a chance to record the sounds of a new environment, new at least to me. I admit that recording urban crowds was not, and still isn't, my greatest interest as a phonographer, but an opportunity is an opportunity.<br /><br />The details that stick out most in my mind are the contrasts to my experiences attending baseball games in my childhood at Boston's Fenway Park. First, the atmosphere was not friendly. There was a scent of violence in the air, and the visiting fans were confined to what looked like a cage, not far from where we were seated. Also, if I recall correctly, no alcohol was available, unheard of at a baseball game. So I sipped my tea, watched the cage, and listened to the taunts and songs and cheers reverberate around the grounds.<br /><br />It was completely unexpected when the announcer asked us to stand and observe a minute's silence, in memory of those killed and injured by the bomb blasts in Madrid a few days earlier. I distinctly remember the rumble of 36,000 people getting to their feet, and I will never forget the breathtaking sensation of being among 36,000 people unaccustomed to, but attempting to maintain, silence.<br /><br />Of course it was nothing like a full minute, and it was nothing close to silent. In the recording, voices can be heard losing their patience within 30 seconds of the whistle blowing; by 40 the tension is close to explosion; and by 47 the referee clearly decides to cut his losses and give the crowd the relief they crave, before they take it themselves, by blowing his whistle to officially mark the end of the 'minute'.<br /><br />But even at 47 seconds, this 'minute' felt, and feels in the recording, long. I'm always amazed by what concentration can do to the perception of time, and amazed by what the act of recording a situation can do to concentration. Many phonographers report that perception of sonic environment, detail, and activity is heightened by the simple act of hitting the record button, whether or not monitoring headphones are being worn. It's as if making the choice and placing the frame allow us to hit an internal button along with the external one, to initiate a breathtaking heightened level of perception. For many years it has been my goal to eliminate the external stimulus and attain this level of attentive listening without the need of machines.<br /><br />So what do we hear? In these 47 seconds we hear the intention of 36,000 people. We hear their movement, we hear the usually masked sounds of a stadium, we hear the city in the background. We hear what seems to be, with the volume raised, a light rain, the shifting of fabric and wooden stands and architecture under the weight of 36,000 bodies. We hear the sound of 72,000 ears hearing the sound of 36,000 bodies without voices. We also hear the tension of 36,000 voices not prepared to remain passive. We have the sensation of a rollercoaster, climbing slowly to the top of the grade, approaching the peak, cresting it, and with the sound of the whistle exploding towards the first valley. 36,000 voices releasing in one go all the tension that has built up in those 47 seconds, that would have been released gradually over the course of that minute if societal convention hadn't demanded participation in a communal act. Maybe it is this somehow involuntary compulsion towards the communal that makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck still every time I hear this recording.<br /><br />And come to think of it, maybe it wasn't me who was sick. Maybe it was my companion that day who almost canceled, but decided against it (he was a proper football fan). Our experiences have blended together in memory, another inadvertently communal act. But I hear us both there, and can still feel either his sickness or mine, and for some reason I always picture birds flying across the pitch when I listen, and I don't know if that is a visual memory, an audible clue, or just my imagination.<br /><br />One last thing: in double-checking White Hart Lane’s capacity just now, I discovered that in May, 2017, less than a year ago, White Hart Lane was closed and demolished. I’m sure this wouldn’t have been news to me had I still been living in North London, but I left the city, and the country, in 2006. So this recording now takes on a new dimension, that of a historical document of another lost sacred (for some) space, lost in time, but preserved here for 47 seconds of not-silence.<br /><br />Patrick Tubin McGinley, April 8th, 2018

a chorus of crickets and katydids, distant frogs and an unidentified bird, to me it sounds similar to a large-tailed nightjar but tonally it is quite different which could be due to the distance and reverb of the forest, or it could be a completely different bird.<br />recorded with an ATBP4025 into an Olympus LS-100.<br /><br />jeremyh.bandcamp.com<br />soundcloud.com/jeremyhegge

this recording was made on an afternoon of a quiet summer weekend in lincoln, uk. it features the flaring up of a thunderstorm with constant thunders raging far in the background while a variety of birds add their sing-sang to the endless ringing of chimes and, after all, occasional rainfall. faint sounds of the surrounding urban environment complete the atmosphere. the recording builds up gradually and after reaching several peaks starts fading into the day.<br />it turned out to be an intense piece of phonography going on for nearly an hour but is well worth your time. please use headphones for maximum pleasure.<br /><br />the recording has been made with a directional condenser stereo mic using the roland R-05 recorder. original format properties: wav 96.0khz/24bit

During their autumn migration northern Europe's cranes gather in tens of thousands at Linum to feed and rest before continuing their journey southwards to Spain. During daylight hours the birds disperse to the surrounding farmlands, but just before dusk, with meticulous punctuality, they return in great numbers to a small area of fields and pools close to the village to roost. It is an amazing sight accompanied by wonderful, evocative sound. Wave after wave of birds in flocks 20 to 80 strong pass overhead in ever evolving V-formations trumpeting as they fly. Equally punctually, crowds of human birdwatchers congregate to see them. Most enjoy the spectacle in silence, but there are always a few murmuring on phones or chatting throughout. Tegel airport is near by and the Berlin/Hamburg motorway just a kilometer away. Heavy trucks drone along the skyline. Tall poplar trees line the paths and yellowing leaves rustle and hiss in the wind. Cows bellow across the landscape. The sounds at place constantly change in their proportions and mix, but they are easy to ignore when the cranes pass overhead filling the sky with their timeless cries.

Birds near Grande Halle, Colombelles, France, Zoom H6
contact microphones on metallic fence in a forest
The very soothing sound of my home from the balcony. At the backyard, children playing, neighbors doing a barbecue. In the gardens, two Common Starling discussing and singing. This bird is exceptional and vocalize very much. In aim to protect the territory, the bird imitates Common Buzzard hunting, European Green Woodpecker distress shout, Blackbird anxiety shout. Also, they imitate Canada Goose, because there's a lot of these birds on the nearby Louvain-La-Neuve lake. In aim to communicate, the bird produce some strange bursts of creaks. The contact shout, when birds are far each other, is a repetitive very harsh shrill sound.<br />These birds are not here every day. They especially like to eat rotten fruits during autumn. It's a real pleasure when they are at home.

The Rhone is a majestic river flowing from Switzerland to a place called Delta in the Camargue area. This river is especially known for its urban course in the Rhone valley, marked by an intense industrial activity and an highly developed business using skippers by river. In Franclens village where we were, Rhone river is located upstream of Lyon, not navigable and in the forest.<br /><br />However it's not quiet. Contrariwise, water is dominated by the hydroelectric dams activity ; for us it's the Genissiat dam. During this recording, the Rhone underwent an enormous dump. Water violently leaves the bed. Unlike a filling, this activity establishes considerable turbulences and noise. It's a tormented atmosphere. But, at the heart of nature and although waters are very lively, it's still and always a soothing recording.<br /><br />---------<br /><br />Le Rhône est un fleuve majestueux prenant sa source en Suisse et débouchant dans le Delta en Camargue. On lui connait surtout son parcours urbain dans la vallée du Rhône, marqué par une activité industrielle intense et une batellerie très développée. A Franclens où nous étions dans l'Ain, le fleuve se situe très en amont de Lyon, non navigable et dans la forêt.<br /><br />Ce n'est pas pour cela que c'est calme. Au contraire. Les eaux sont dominées par les barrages hydro-électriques, nous concernant principalement Génissiat, tout proche. Durant cet enregistrement, le Rhône subit une énorme chasse. Les eaux quittent violemment le lit. Au contraire d'un remplissage, il est produit d'importantes turbulences et du bruit. C'est cette ambiance tourmentée que retraduit l'enregistrement. En plein cœur de la nature, bien que les eaux soient très vives, ça en est encore et toujours apaisant.

There's nothing more magical than the first bird shout on the morning. In the middle of the night, forest is a wide silent. Slowly dawn arrives, a distant hubbub is heard and the first shout emerges from the forest. Birds intensely sing in the morning in order to celebrate the fact of having survived the night (for this reason blackbirds make many shrill screams during nightfall because of anxiety). A quiet morning allows birds to reaffirm their territory possession, shouting clearly to the others. In this remote path in the forest of Montagnole (Savoy, France), I was immediately seduced by these woods immensely filled with blackbirds shouts. This is why I recorded them rising from 4:30 in the morning to later. Unfortunately the places is drowned in a constant flood of planes vomit sounds, but I had no choice. Early and temporarily exempt by this misery, I can give this recording, awakening with blackbirds.<br /><br />0:48 - The first shout of the morning.<br />4:00 - Unleashed dogs.<br />12:00 to 17:25 - A local blackbird above the recorder.<br />18:30 to 24:30 - Dogs and a local blackbird above the recorder.<br />26:00 - Pause.<br />39:33 - Robin begins to sing.<br />47:13 - An Eurasian Jay imitates a cat.<br />50:37 - Far, a Tawny Owl.<br /><br />Recorded in Montagnole (France), 2017 June 7, from 4:40 AM to 5:40 AM.<br /><br />---------<br /><br />Une heure avec le réveil des merles<br /><br />Il n'y a rien de plus magique que le premier cri de la cohue. En plein cœur de la nuit, la forêt est silencieuse, doucement l'aube arrive, un lointain brouhaha se fait, puis ça y est, le premier cri émerge de la forêt. Les oiseaux chantent intensément le matin afin de fêter le fait d'avoir survécu à la nuit (tout comme les merles font à ce titre de nombreux cris stridents à la tombée de la nuit étant donné que cela les angoisse). Le matin, en principe plus calme leur permet de réaffirmer la possession de leur territoire. En ce lieu reculé de Savoie en forêt de Montagnole, j'ai immédiatement été séduit par ces bois immensément remplis de merles. C'est de la sorte qu

These sounds taken from an extended recording on the night of the summer solstice 2017 (20/21 June) from our garden in Mikro Papingo. This recording comprises two fragments: At about 2.30 am the Scops owl begins to wind down his mournful calljust as the first birds start their early morning song. Later on our drama queen donkey who grazes in the other village across the valley gives its first sad eeyore for the day; so echoing the scops I wanted to put them together. You can also hear distant goat bells, dogs and a mystery animal sneeze. Recorded using 2 Primo EM172 capsules made up by Ian Brady (WSRS) mounted in my homemade lightweight SASS (ref Vicki Powys et al) to an Olympus LS 11. No editing apart from selection, fade i/o and cross fade for donkey
Very loud colourful parakeets in the palm trees next to the lake. In the background you can hear children playing in the park, and occasionally bangs from the boats tied up in the lake.

Hot summer afternoon beside on a country road near Houghton Lake, Michigan.

Sea birds 100+ miles from of the Pacific Ocean look for clams in this salt slough, formed from wastewater and saline soil due to over farming. The soil here was once beneath the Great Tulare Lake, the largest lake in the US west of the Mississippi River before it was drained in the early 20th century to form what is now part of California's bread basket.

I am exploring the sounds of my commute. After I park at Barton, I walk down the very busy and noisy London road. This moment when I turn off that main road and start heading for the quiet backstreets is the first part of the journey where you can find details; you can hear individual footsteps, the sounds of birds, the sounds of someone working at the back of the supermarket. Yes, you can also hear the deep bass rumble of London Road, but it's interesting to find so much detail and variety even so close to that very noisy road. The wind was extremely strong on this day, sorry for the bass of the recordings, those Naiant X-X omnis don't do so well on a really breezy day...

During their autumn migration northern Europe's cranes gather in hundreds of thousands at Linum to feed up before continuing their journey southwards. They are an amazing sight. Puctually, at dusk, flocks of up to 50 birds pass overhead in ever evolving formations trumpeting as they go. Equally punctual, herds of human birdwatchers turn up to see them, chatting to each other and murmuring on their phones. The Berlin/Hamburg motorway is a kilometer away and Tegel airport nearby. The weather on this evening was rainy and yellowing poplar leaves were hissing in the wind. These are the sound sources for this recording.

frogs and birds recorded early morning
This is a recording made from the casement windows of an old Victorian cottage in which I was staying in order to record the sounds of the domestic interior of a period property. It was quite cold and dark and I was ill when I was there. But when I was organising my things for the final night of my stay, I noticed the amazing bird sounds from the window of the bedroom on the very top floor. It was an incredible sound - the starlings passing, the wind howling, even the blurry and annoying sounds of the traffic and planes on nearby roads... I wanted to record it. There is a lot of wind in the recording and I could have had the levels a little higher to get a better noise/signal ratio, but the starlings passing over at around 5-6 minutes in are amazing. You can hear me going out to the coal bunker as well, and filling the enamel water jug. Recorded with FOSTEX FR-2LE using Naiant X-X omni-directionals.

Vogelsang, trees now grow unhindered throughout this abandoned Soviet military base, now a nature reserve. It is a 2km walk from the station or nearest road. One is free to explore the derelict buildings, which are open to the wind and weather. It is an atmospheric place that surprises with unexpected details like colourful murals and attractive wallpapers in decaying rooms. There is a onetime theater and a sports hall with ancient heating pipes dangling down the walls. Lenin still stands carved out in stone. Forest wildlife is abundant and the springtime birds a joy to hear.

This is the sound in a quiet corner of Port Meadow; one of the many places in Oxford which is extremely rural and where county life meets city life. Horses and cattle graze on the meadow; folk enjoy swimming and boating on the Thames; many people enjoy walking on the green; and large trains pass on the rail line directly next to it. In this recording I was trying to capture something of the ambience of this place; a very simple recording made with EDIROL R-09 in the grass underneath a tree.

Ralf beginning to tell, and opens the window to the forest… <br /><br />The “Radio Runde Hamm” (RRH) is an open studio, where residents can come to make Radio programmes, or learn how to do it. A group of radio-enthusiasts between 17 and 70 years old is “running the show”, assisting and training new-comers.

A lovely situation which I had passed in the car the day before; sheep grazing right beside the water, actually going right down to the water to eat the seaweed in some places. These sheep - like all prey, I guess - ran away from me as soon as I approached them, so I set my FOSTEX FR-2LE and Naiant X-X microphones down in the grass near a bit of bank covered in bits of wool (I think the sheep scratch against the earth there) and went away onto the other side of the bank, so as to hopefully encourage the sheep to approach my recorder, and remove my own threatening presence from their grazing area. You can faintly hear the sheep passing through the grass, and baa-ing to each other, you can also hear the wind, and some birds quite distantly. It's very windy in Shetland, especially in an exposed spot like this.

The usual suspects are there, a srilankan broom brushing the leaves away, the crows, the chipmunks and various other birds that I can't name including a very close visitor towards the end of the track. Its much quieter than usual because its a holiday and its the only day of the year that I haven't seen any buses (the noisiest most dangerous things around) on the road. You can even hear the waves of the sea if you listen carefully.

On a beautiful sunny morning, the Hurtières forest big calm was immediately seductive. This explains why a recorder was left alone, hanged on a beech branch. This quiet recording includes dominant songs of the eurasian blackcap, the short-toed treecreeper and the yellowhammer (tsi-tsi-tsi-tsi-tsi-tih-tuh). More discreet are the common chiffchaff, the common chaffinch, the dunnock, the blackbird. Unfortunately, there's also planes, but this place was like that.<br /><br />---------<br /><br />Par un beau matin ensoleillé, le grand calme de la forêt des Hurtières s'est immédiatement annoncé séduisant. C'est de la sorte qu'un enregistreur a été laissé seul, accroché à la branche d'un hêtre. Cet apaisant témoignage sonore comporte les chants dominants de la fauvette à tête noire, le grimpereau des jardins et le bruant jaune (tsi-tsi-tsi-tsi-tsi-tih-tuh). De manière plus discrète, on peut entendre le pouillot véloce, le pinson, l'accenteur mouchet, le merle.

Recorded bird calls to scare real birds away from the vines. Nova Scotian wine has a fast growing reputation and sound is used, alongside nets, to protect the grapes from hungry beaks.

The place where we stayed for Wool Week had a couple of trees in the back garden, in which large quantities of birds roosted each night. We kept the window open to hear the lovely sounds while cooking each evening. There were also some building works in the area that we could hear through the open window and - very faintly - the reassuring chimes of the clock of Lerwick Town Hall.

In one of the few streets still arborized of Manaus, some birds maintain a pastoral soundscape punctuated by the steady stream of cars. Some children home from school.
I was walking out of the Warburg Nature Reserve, where I had gone to listen. As I passed into an area with a clearing on the right, I heard the most beautiful bird song. I am not sure what bird this is, but I think it is from the songbird family? Perhaps some kind of Thrush? Its voice was being amplified beautifully by the shape of the space, the tree trunks, and the open cavern created by the clearing. I could hear pheasants distantly, too, and at some point there was a light rain. Just a dusting of it. After shuffling around to find the exact right place to stand and listen, I settled into a stillness, and was so quiet that a tiny mouse emerged from the ground near to me and began to bustle in the bushes. There we were, mouse, birds, planes, rain, space. Beautiful.

clearing works in the forest. tractor equipped with garbing module, moving cut-down trees on a trailer and pulling out tangled bushes. further in the distance sounds of a bigger machinery working on a patch of expressway - the A98. this part of the express way will cut off two villages (Minseln and Krasau) from each other and it's a point of concern for the inhabitants as they want to keep in direct contact. As far as I know there are talks about a tunnel but not much is being decided on.

This is the sound under the water near a field full of grazing sheep, in Shetland. The recording was made with one of Jez Riley French's hydrophones plugged into a FOSTEX FR-2LE. You can hear the activity of the tide, and some of the scraping noises as the same tide pushes the hydrophone against the rocks. I don't know if the nearby sheep are grown for wool or for meat, but their proximity to the sea was interesting to me, as on mainland Britain I have rarely seen sheep so near to the ocean.

It is not every day when I am free from traffic noise. But when it happens it is possible to notice other small sounds in the surroundings.<br />That happened in beginning of June 2012 when I was at Krossholt at Barðastönd, in the northwest of Iceland.<br />One night someone was playing loud music in the neighborhood. The rumbling bass beat was noticeable all night along. During the night the wind started to blow from east with strong gusts. Suddenly nearby power line started to give a strange sound and the niggling beat from the neighborhood started to be interesting. In combination with the wind, power line, birdsong from the field and nearby cliff it started to be like a music from other planet. In fact it was a really interesting composition. Better than many modern human made compositions today. The intro is more than two minutes long, so just lay back in your chair, relax and listen.<br />High quality headphones are recommended.<br /><br />Longer version with this recording can be found at:<br />http://fieldrecording.net/2012/06/22/opus-for-power-line-bass-wind-and-birds/

Captured this on lunch break. These sounds are very familiar to locals. <br />The local population of rainbow lorikeets came from a local university that had a selection in captivity, but they escaped. That small nucleus of birds bred and bred and now they are very common, and a huge pest to orchards and farms. They are, however, objectively stunning. <br /><br />This tree had several species of birds in it, but I couldn't keep my eyes off a pair of rainbow lorikeets, sitting atop the tree.<br /><br />Recorded with a Zoom h2n, with a zoom wind jammer fitted. I stuck it on a selfie stick and held it up to get closer to the birds. ATH-MX40 headphones. XY Mode (I'm experimenting with XY mode, rather than MS at the moment)

I revisited the site of a road protest - the Glen of the Downs - in 2002. I had lived there in 1997. I wanted to document this nature reserve with a major road running through it in sound, because my main memory of the place was of being awoken at 4am each morning by the crystal tones of the stream ringing out in the forest. Each day all day the traffic would drown out this sound, but it would rise in the middle of the night. I was not experienced enough as a recordist to realise when I made this recording that really I should have gone at night to recreate that sense, but for now you can get a little bit of the stream's sonic texture, even with the din of the midday traffic in the background. recorded with unknown microphone and minidisc.

The Samangeum Seawall (새만금 방조제) was completed in 2006 and extends out into the West Sea. Arriving at night we could hear a constant, very dense and largely undifferentiated sound coming from activity out to sea although there were few lights visible on the ocean. The seawall is near the large port of Gunsan. A continuous recording was made, and various filters have been applied so as to explore aspects of the sound that was recorded.

This is the sound in a clearing in the Glen of the Downs, of different birds, aeroplanes and the traffic on the N11. There was a road protest in this nature reserve at which I briefly lived in the Autumn/Winter of 1997 and we had a reunion this year to mark 20 years since the first protest tent went up.

it was unclear to us what this high pole might have been used for - it was perhaps 20 meters ligh and supported at 4 points with now fairly loose cabling. it was too old to be a cellphone mast, but perhaps it supported some piece of radar equipment from soviet times. in any case the light wind resonated the bass frequencies of the slackened cables, while birds and the scraping of tall grass can also be heard.<br /><br />recorded to an oade-modded fostex fr2-le with self-made contact mics.

This is the sound of us bottling up a batch of beer. The first job involves sterilising all the bottles, so the bubbling sound is me filling up loads of glass bottles with sterilising solution. As soon as I heard the first bottle glugging, I thought "this is a lovely sound! I want to record it for World Listening Day!" So I went and got the recorder. You can hear some chit chat about that; then we bicker about Mark drinking extra beer out of some of the bottles to get the liquid levels right; we fiddle around with the fancy bottle-capping device. Traffic moves on the street, very slowly, you can hear the wonderful birds in our neighbourhood, mostly sparrows in this recording. All the timings are made by our work together as we sterilise the bottles, fill them with beer, cap the bottles then rinse them down. It's a batch of 30 bottles.
Some inner field recordings as its still freezing outside :)<br />there is a nice reverb in this laboratory waiting room.<br />PCM-M10, internal microphones.

This recording was made along a bend in the road near a leasing office. The recording features cars and golf carts traveling around the bend, birds, relatively indistinct speech from people walking along one side of the road, and an overhead plane. Recording done with a Tascam Dr-22WL and a dead cat windscreen. Some EQ was applied to cut out rumble in the low end.
